				<b>Conditional tiles</b> are used to create a fork in the road of your program's execution. Depending on the outcome of the chosen condition, your program may
				continue in one of two different directions. The simplest conditional is the <b>IF-THEN-ELSE</b> tile shown at the left. This tile checks 
              to see if the touch sensor attached to pin 1 is touching 
              something.. If this condition is met the path indicated by the green check mark is taken. If not, the path indicated by the red
				"X" is taken. So, overall, what this particular program does is 
              Play a rising tone if the sensor is touching something, and plays 
              a falling tone if it is not.

				Conditionals are inserted into your program the same as other tiles. Just click on the conditional button and a cursor will appear as you mouse over the worksheet,
				showing you where the conditional can be inserted. When you click it into place, the conditional edit box will appear, as shown to the left. Here you can select what
				condition you want to test by clicking one of the four multiple-choice boxes until that condition appears. For most conditions, the slider at the bottom can be used to
				place further restrictions on when the condition is TRUE, such as a required number of consecutive observations of that condition.<p>
				The remaining button is used to switch the TRUE and FALSE directions, as the example illustrates. Notice that the reversed directions are highlighted in black to make
				them more obvious in your program.<p>
				When a conditional is placed, it creates several locations where additional tiles may be inserted. One is immediately to the bottom of the tile and is normally the program
				fork corresponding to a TRUE condition. In the example, though, we've reversed TRUE and FALSE, so here it's the path taken by the FALSE condition. Another insertion
				point is the arrow to the right of the tile. This is normally the path taken by the FALSE condition. But again, since we've reversed TRUE and FALSE, it's the other way
				around. A third insertion point is the arrow below the conditional tile. This occurs where the forking program paths rejoin. A tile place here will execute regardless of
				whether the condition was TRUE or FALSE.

				By inserting additional conditionals in this fashion, you can create multi-way branching in your program, as the example to the left illustrates. Here, all possible
				touch sensors conditions are being tested with a motion response for each one. 
                The first is if the touch sensor connected to pin 1 is touching 
                something, the second is if the touch sensors in pin 2 is 
                touching something, and the third is is both are touching 
                something.&nbsp; Notice that the last condition (neither sensor 
                touching) doesn't need an explicit test, since it
				will be the one that's TRUE if, and only if, the other three are FALSE.

				If you need to further restrict a condition with an additional condition, use the <b>AND-IF</b> tile. It can <i>only</i> be inserted below another conditional or AND-IF
				tile, as shown to the left. In this example, IF the touch sensor 
              in pin 1 is pressed AND IF the touch sensor in pin 2 is pressed, 
              then the motion will happen. . <i>Both </i>&nbsp;conditions have to be TRUE for the entire conditional to be TRUE; otherwise the entire conditional is deemed FALSE,

				Seven different flags can be raised or lowered with the <a href = "actiontiles.html#FlagTile">flag action tile</a>. The flag conditional can check any of these flags
				to see if they're up or not. In the example to the left, the 
              sound played will reflect the condition of the red flag: Oh-no&nbsp; if it's up; 
              the phone will ring if it's down.

				You can further restrict some conditional tiles by requiring a certain number (up to 8) of consecutive observations before the condition is deemed TRUE. This is done
				using the slider at the bottom of the edit box. In the example to the left, an 
                obstacke will have to have been observed on the IR Sensor 
                connected to pins 5 and 6 <i>at least three times

				If you use the same condition more than once in an ELSE-IF arrangement, but with different numbers of consecutive observations required, be sure to put the most
				restrictive condition first, as shown at the left. If these two tiles had been switched, the tile requiring only a single observation would still be true even if
				three consecutive observations had been made. Because conditions are checked in sequence, it would register TRUE first, so you'd never get to check the more
				restrictive condition.

				&nbsp;There are two ways to detect obstacles with your robot; using the 
              touch sensors, or using the IR sensors.&nbsp; The condition tile 
              indicates the pin that the sensor you are testing should be 
              connect to on your BotBrain Board.&nbsp; The example to the left 
              indicates that the IR sensor should be connect to pins 5 and 6.&nbsp; 
              The placement of the sensor on your robot depends on what you are 
              using the sensor for.&nbsp; For example, if you are following the 
              right hand wall to solve a maze, the touch sensor in pin 1 might 
              be on the right of the robot, and the touch sensor in pin 2 might 
              be the front.
			  <p>The touch sensors can be used to &quot;bump and turn&quot;.&nbsp; If they 
              hit something the robot will turn.&nbsp; This is good for maze 
              solving and obstacle avoidance.</p>
              <p>The IR Sensors can be used for the same purposes; &quot;seeing&quot; the 
              walls of the maze, or obstacles in front of the robot.&nbsp; They 
              can also be used to detect a drop off for table top navigation.

				The <b>light sensors</b> are used in pairs.&nbsp; Where you put 
              them on the robot depends on what you are doing with the robot.&nbsp; 
              This program assumes that you are doing photovore (driving toward 
              the light) The brighter the light shining on any given sensor, the higher
				the number it will return. These numbers can be compared with each other&nbsp; various combinations to achieve TRUE/FALSE conditions.<p>
				There are several different conditions that can be checked, in four categories:<p>
				1. Sensor value (left or right) is at least <b>x</b>.<br>
				2. Sensor (left or right) is the brighter by at least <b>x</b>.<br>
				3. The  average sensor value is at least <b>x</b>.<p>
				The value of "<b>x</b>" can range from 1 to 255 and is adjusted using the slider. As you move the slider, the graphic in the box illustrates the condition
				being checked. In the example, the light sensor in pin 3 must return a value of at least 
                15 more than the sensor in pin 4 for
				the condition to be TRUE. (Meaning that it is brighter on the 
                pin 3 side.)</div>

				This condition enables you to add some randomness to your programs. This is useful when your 
              robot gets stuck in a corner, for example, and you need to vary
				the techniques required to free it. It can also be used to vary the sounds played under a given set of circumstances. For this condition to be TRUE the coin flip
				has to have come up "heads". You can require that anywhere from 1 to 8 consecutive 
              coin flips has to yield "heads" for the condition to be TRUE. This is done with
				the slider control. Doing so varies the probability of the result being TRUE by cutting it in half with each successive increment in the required number of
				consecutive "heads". The probability for one "heads" is 1/2; for two, 1/4; for three, 1/8; etc.
