				<img src = "begend.gif" class = "left" width="112" height="154">
				When you first start the BotBrain Program Maker, you will be presented with a new <b>worksheet</b>. The worksheet is where you will place the <b>tiles</b> that
				make up your BotBrain program.
				The main program always begins at the red "start" tile labeled with the green gear. It ends with the red "end" tile labeled with the yellow- and black-striped
				barricade. The program shown here is empty and doesn't do a thing. If you were to load this program into the BotBrain, it wouldn't do anything either, except
				sit there, staring blankly.
				<p> To make the BotBrain do something, you have to add tiles to its program. The tiles are selected using the buttons in the lefthand
				column, and must always be inserted between two existing tiles on the worksheet. (The one exception to this is when you define a new subroutine, covered later in
				this tutorial.)

			<div id = "Navigating"><p class = "doc2">Navigating the Worksheet</p>
				<img src = "scroll.gif" class = "left" width="106" height="121">
				As you build a program, it will often become larger than the worksheet window. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to navigate. The most obvious, of course, are
				the scrollbars, to the bottom and right of the window. Less obvious is the <b>autoscrolling</b> system. As your mouse pointer nears the edge of the worksheet window,
				it will change to a little arrow and a rectangle, as shown at the left. After a short delay, the worksheet will begin to scroll in a direction opposite to the arrow.
				This will continue until either the edge of the worksheet is reached, or the mouse pointer is removed from the edge of the window.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div>
				<img src = "zoom.gif" width="227" class = "left">
				There is also a <b>zoom out</b> button (the one with the magnifying glass -- or rather a <i>minifying</i> glass). By clicking on this button, the entire worksheet
				will shrink to a size that will fit within the confines of its window, and all of its tiles will show up as miniature colored rectangles. the mouse pointer changes into a
				little corner icon, as shown. Anywhere on the worksheet you click this icon will become the new upper-lefthand corner of the worksheet window, and the worksheet will
				return to its standard magnification.
				<p>
				You need never worry about running off the bottom of the worksheet with your programs, as it will simply expand to accomodate them.

			  &nbsp;<img border="0" src="gettin11.jpg" align="left" width="101" height="199"><p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To insert a tile into your program, you must first select it using one of the <b>tool buttons</b> on the lefthand side of the screen. When you click on one of these
				buttons, it will light up, signifying the tool you have chosen. Here, the
            <b>Insert Motion</b> tool has been chosen.			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div>
				<img src = "insert.gif" class = "left" width="142" height="168">
				Next, move the mouse pointer out onto the worksheet. When you position the pointer between two tiles, as shown here, a <b>cursor</b> will appear, indicating that it's
				okay to insert the selected tile into the chosen position. Sometimes, the cursor may not appear where you want to insert a tile. This indicates that the position
				you've chosen is not a valid location for the that particular tile, and you will not be allowed to insert the tile there. The BotBrain Program Maker will not let
				you generate a program containing errors.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "LEDTile">
				<img border="0" src="gettin12.jpg" align="left" width="586" height="430">
				Once you've positioned the pointer where you want the tile, and the cursor appears, <b>click</b> the mouse once. The tile you've selected will appear, hovering above the
				worksheet. In most cases, a <b>configuration box</b> will also pop up, allowing you to configure the tile for the actions you want it to perform. In this case, clicking
				on the colored tiles on the left will choose a motion the robot will 
                perform. </div>

			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Next, click on the green checkmark. (The green checkmark 
                always means &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;, or &quot;true&quot;. The red &quot;X&quot; always means 
                &quot;no&quot;, &quot;not okay&quot;, or &quot;false&quot;.) When you've done this, the tile 
                will nestle into place on the worksheet, reflecting the action 
                you've chosen. At this point, you have a real program that 
                actually does something: it drives the robot forward at half 
                speed.</div>

			<div id = "LoadProgram"><p class = "doc2">Uploading a Program</p>
				<img border="0" src="gettin14.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="72">
				To try out your new program, you will need to connect the BotBrain to your computer's serial port. Once you've done this, turn on the BotBrain's power switch.
				You should be holding onto the BotBrain when you do this, or else have it sitting on a block of some sort, so its wheels are not in contact with anything. This is 
				in case the program currently loaded causes the wheels to turn. You don't want your BotBrain rolling off the table!<p>
				Next click the <b>upload</b> button, as shown here. Your program will then be 
                transferred to the BotBrain. When it's finished, it will begin 
                executing automatically. In this case, both wheels should turn 
                in the forward direction.

			<div id = "EditProgram"><p class = "doc2">Editing a Program</p>
				<img border="0" src="gettin15.jpg" align="left" width="502" height="246">
				But suppose what you really wanted was the robot to go full 
              speed. No problem! You can add, change, or delete tiles in your program until it's just the way you want it.
				There are a couple ways to <b>select</b> a tile to edit:<p>
				1. You can <b>click</b> on the <b>select button</b> (pointing finger), then <b>click</b> on the tile(s) you want to select. Just continue clicking on tiles to add to the selection.
				If you find you've selected too many, you can start over with a <b>double-click</b> on any tile to select it by itself. There are some limitations to this, however. You can't
				select part of a program block that includes just one of its boundaries. For example, if you tried to select just the "start program" tile, you'd end up selecting the
				entire program. This is to ensure that you don't delete incomplete program blocks, leaving behind a malformed program. It's part of BotBrain's guarantee that your
				program will never contain errors.<p>
				2. You can <b>right-click</b> on any tile at any time to select it. This also automatically clicks the select button for you, so you can continue to select more tiles
				or edit the one(s) selected.<p>
				Once a tile or group of tiles has been selected, you can right-click on it to bring up the <b>edit menu</b>, as shown here. The edit menu contains buttons for <b>copying</b> 
                to the clipboard (the two sheets of paper), <b>cutting</b> to the clipboard (the scissors) and <b>deleting</b> (the trashcan). Each of these will light up when you select it, and you can
				select only one. To cancel a selection, just click on it again. To make the selected action take place, click the "okay" button (the green checkmark).<p>
				If you've selected just one tile, or a single syntactic group of tiles, such as a loop or conditional (covered later), there will also be a button on the far left which
				displays the type of tile or group selected. When you click on this button, the original edit screen for the tile or group comes up, enabling you to change its contents.<p>
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Copying">
				<img border="0" src="gettin16.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="83">
				For the sake of this example, rather than editing the tile that's there, we're going to copy and paste it, then edit the copy. So first click on the copy button, then
				the "okay" (green checkmark) button. This copies the selected tile(s) to the clipboard. It also automatically selects the clipboard for insertion.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Pasting">
				<img border="0" src="gettin17.jpg" align="left" width="195" height="244"><img src = "rightarrow.gif" class = "left" width="32" height="32"><img border="0" src="gettin18.jpg" align="left" width="111" height="292">
				With the clipboard selected, move the mousepointer just below the original LED tile, and click. A clone of that tile will be inserted into position from the clipboard.
				You can think of the clipboard as just another tile (or group of tiles) to be inserted. And, as with single tiles, the program will not let you insert tiles from the
				clipboard into places they don't belong.

			<div id = "Reediting">
				<img border="0" src="gettin19.jpg" align="left" width="284" height="111">
				Now right-click on the cloned tile to select it, and again to bring up the edit menu. But this time click the 
                Motion button at the far left of the menu. This will cause
				the Motion configuration menu to pop up once again.

				<img src = "calibrate.gif" class = "left" width="98" height="69">
				The BotBrain comes from the factory with motor calibration constants and default light sensor constants programmed in. However, after an initial break-in period, if
				your BotBrain seems to have trouble moving in a straight line when you tell it to,
				it may be desirable to adjust the calibration. It's a simple process. Here's how to do it.<p>
				First, upload the calibration program using the <b>calibrate</b> button, shown here.<p>
				
				Place the BotBrain on a smooth surface where it has room to move forward.
				Then <b>press the reset button four times</b> in rapid succession. After a short delay, the BotBrain will <b>roll forward, then back</b>. While rolling forward, be sure to
				observe whether it moves straight, or curves to the right or left.<p>
				If it curves right, you will want to <b>adjust it to move left</b> a little more. To do this press the reset button <b>twice</b> in rapid succession. The left LED
				will flash, indicating the desired correction has been made. You can do this as many times as necessary.<p>
				If it curves left, you will want to <b>adjust it to move right</b> a little more. To do this press the reset button <b>three times</b> in rapid succession. The
				right LED will flash, indicating the desired correction has been made. You can do this as many times as necessary.<p>
				You can always <b>check your adjustments</b> by pressing the reset button <b>four times</b> in rapid succession and watching the BotBrain move forward and back.<p>
				To <b>calibrate the light sensors</b>, place the BotBrain on a flat surface in a well-lit room. Press the reset button <b>five times</b> in rapid succession, then
				stand back and <i>stand still</i>. The BotBrain will play a short tune and then begin to spin around on its center about five or six times.
				(If the room is too dark it will stop before the entire sequence is finished and emit a low-pitched buzz. Just brighten the room and try again.) It's important that there not be any motion in
				the BotBrain's field of view while it's spinning, so stand still! When the rotations stop, the BotBrain will play a final "Ta Da!", whereupon its 
				light sensors will have been calibrated.<p>
				To <b>erase the BotBrain's motor and light calibration</b> info and start over, press the reset button <b>six times</b> in rapid succession. You will hear two
				beeps, signifying that default calibration values have been set.<p>
				<i>None of these operations have any effect on the current worksheet. But you <i>do</i> have to upload the worksheet program to the BotBrain again in order to use it.</i>
