		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "NewWorksheet"><p class = "doc2">The New Worksheet</p>
				<img src = "../images/begend.gif" class = "left">
				When you first start the Scribbler Program Maker, you will be presented with a new <b>worksheet</b>. The worksheet is where you will place the <b>tiles</b> that
				make up your Scribbler program.
				The main program always begins at the red "start" tile labeled with the green gear. It ends with the red "end" tile labeled with the yellow- and black-striped
				barricade. The program shown here is empty and doesn't do a thing. If you were to load this program into the Scribbler, it wouldn't do anything either, except
				sit there, staring blankly.<p> To make the Scribbler do something, you have to add tiles to its program. The tiles are selected using the buttons in the lefthand
				column, and must always be inserted between two existing tiles on the worksheet. (The one exception to this is when you define a new subroutine, covered later in
				this tutorial.)
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Navigating"><p class = "doc2">Navigating the Worksheet</p>
				<img src = "../images/scroll.gif" class = "left">
				As you build a program, it will often become larger than the worksheet window. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to navigate. The most obvious, of course, are
				the scrollbars, to the bottom and right of the window. Less obvious is the <b>autoscrolling</b> system. As your mouse pointer nears the edge of the worksheet window,
				it will change to a little arrow and a rectangle, as shown at the left. After a short delay, the worksheet will begin to scroll in a direction opposite to the arrow.
				This will continue until either the edge of the worksheet is reached, or the mouse pointer is removed from the edge of the window.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div>
				<img src = "../images/zoom.gif" class = "left">
				There is also a <b>zoom out</b> button (the one with the magnifying glass -- or rather a <i>minifying</i> glass). By clicking on this button, the entire worksheet
				will shrink to a size that will fit within the confines of its window, and all of its tiles will show up as miniature colored rectangles. the mouse pointer changes into a
				little corner icon, as shown. Anywhere on the worksheet you click this icon will become the new upper-lefthand corner of the worksheet window, and the worksheet will
				return to its standard magnification.<p>
				You need never worry about running off the bottom of the worksheet with your programs, as it will simply expand to accomodate them.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "InsertTile"><p class = "doc2">Inserting a Tile</p>
				<img src = "../images/selectled.gif" class = "left">
				To insert a tile into your program, you must first select it using one of the <b>tool buttons</b> on the lefthand side of the screen. When you click on one of these
				buttons, it will light up, signifying the tool you have chosen. Here, the <b>LED On/Off</b> tool has been chosen.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div>
				<img src = "../images/insert.gif" class = "left">
				Next, move the mouse pointer out onto the worksheet. When you position the pointer between two tiles, as shown here, a <b>cursor</b> will appear, indicating that it's
				okay to insert the selected tile into the chosen position. Sometimes, the cursor may not appear where you want to insert a tile. This indicates that the position
				you've chosen is not a valid location for the that particular tile, and you will not be allowed to insert the tile there. The Scribbler Program Maker will not let
				you generate a program containing errors.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "LEDTile">
				<img src = "../images/insertled.gif" class = "left">
				Once you've positioned the pointer where you want the tile, and the cursor appears, <b>click</b> the mouse once. The tile you've selected will appear, hovering above the
				worksheet. In most cases, a <b>configuration box</b> will also pop up, allowing you to configure the tile for the actions you want it to perform. In this case, clicking
				on the switches will control what you want the LEDs to do. They can each be turned on, turned off, or left alone (designated by a red-striped switch cover). For this
				example, we'll turn the left LED on and the middle and right LEDs off.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div>
				<img src = "../images/ledinserted.gif" class = "left">
				Next, click on the green checkmark. (The green checkmark always means "yes", "okay", or "true". The red "X" always means "no", "not okay", or "false".) When you've
				done this, the tile will nestle into place on the worksheet, reflecting the action you've chosen. At this point, you have a real program that actually does something:
				it turns the lefthand LED "on".
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "LoadProgram"><p class = "doc2">Uploading a Program</p>
				<img src = "../images/upload.gif" class = "left">
				To try out your new program, you will need to connect the Scribbler to your computer's serial port. Once you've done this, turn on the Scribbler's power switch.
				You should be holding onto the Scribbler when you do this, or else have it sitting on a block of some sort, so its wheels are not in contact with anything. This is 
				in case the program currently loaded causes the wheels to turn. You don't want your Scribbler rolling off the table!<p>
				Next click the <b>upload</b> button, as shown here. Your program will then be transfered to the Scribbler. When it's finished, it will begin executing automatically. In this
				case, you should see the lefthand LED come on.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "EditProgram"><p class = "doc2">Editing a Program</p>
				<img src = "../images/edit.gif" class = "left">
				But suppose what you really wanted was the righthand LED to come on. No problem! You can add, change, or delete tiles in your program until it's just the way you want it.
				There are a couple ways to <b>select</b> a tile to edit:<p>
				1. You can <b>click</b> on the <b>select button</b> (pointing finger), then <b>click</b> on the tile(s) you want to select. Just continue clicking on tiles to add to the selection.
				If you find you've selected too many, you can start over with a <b>double-click</b> on any tile to select it by itself. There are some limitations to this, however. You can't
				select part of a program block that includes just one of its boundaries. For example, if you tried to select just the "start program" tile, you'd end up selecting the
				entire program. This is to ensure that you don't delete incomplete program blocks, leaving behind a malformed program. It's part of Scribbler's guarantee that your
				program will never contain errors.<p>
				2. You can <b>right-click</b> on any tile at any time to select it. This also automatically clicks the select button for you, so you can continue to select more tiles
				or edit the one(s) selected.<p>
				Once a tile or group of tiles has been selected, you can right-click on it to bring up the <b>edit menu</b>, as shown here. The edit menu contains buttons for <b>copying</b> to the
				clipboard (the two green tiles), <b>cutting</b> to the clipboard (the scissors) and <b>deleting</b> (the trashcan). Each of these will light up when you select it, and you can
				select only one. To cancel a selection, just click on it again. To make the selected action take place, click the "okay" button (the green checkmark).<p>
				If you've selected just one tile, or a single syntactic group of tiles, such as a loop or conditional (covered later), there will also be a button on the far left which
				displays the type of tile or group selected. When you click on this button, the original edit screen for the tile or group comes up, enabling you to change its contents.<p>
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Copying">
				<img src = "../images/copy.gif" class = "left">
				For the sake of this example, rather than editing the tile that's there, we're going to copy and paste it, then edit the copy. So first click on the copy button, then
				the "okay" (green checkmark) button. This copies the selected tile(s) to the clipboard. It also automatically selects the clipboard for insertion.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Pasting">
				<img src = "../images/paste.gif" class = "left"><img src = "../images/rightarrow.gif" class = "left"><img src = "../images/pasted.gif" class = "left">
				With the clipboard selected, move the mousepointer just below the original LED tile, and click. A clone of that tile will be inserted into position from the clipboard.
				You can think of the clipboard as just another tile (or group of tiles) to be inserted. And, as with single tiles, the program will not let you insert tiles from the
				clipboard into places they don't belong.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Reediting">
				<img src = "../images/reedit.gif" class = "left">
				Now right-click on the cloned tile to select it, and again to bring up the edit menu. But this time click the LED button at the far left of the menu. This will cause
				the LED configuration menu to pop up once again.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div>
				<img src = "../images/changeleds.gif" class = "left">
				Here, you can click on the switches to change which LEDs you want to turn on or off. In the example, the left LED is turned off, the center one remains unchanged, and
				the right one is turned on. Once you click "okay", here is what results:
				<table><tr><td>
					<img src = "../images/editedleds.gif" class = "left">
					If you were to upload this program to the Scribbler, you would probably only see the righthand light come on. The lefthand light from the first tile would flash on
					so briefly that you wouldn't even be able to see it.
				</td></tr></table>
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Deleting">
				<img src = "../images/delete.gif" class = "left">
				So you might as well just get rid of the first tile. To do so, select it and then right-click to bring up the edit menu. Click on the <b>delete</b> (trashcan) button.
				You could also click on the <b>cut</b> (scissors) button, and the effect would be the same, except that the deleted item would also be copied to the clipboard.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Saving"><p class = "doc2">Saving a Program</p>
				<img src = "../images/save.gif" class = "left">
				Here's what's left after the delete. You can <b>save</b> this file to the hard drive for later retrieval simply by clicking the <b>save file</b> button, as shown. This will bring up
				a file save dialog box that will let you choose a name for your file and select a location to store it.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "New"><p class = "doc2">Clearing the Worksheet</p>
				<img src = "../images/new.gif" class = "left">
				Once your program is saved (or if you don't care if it gets zapped), you can clear the worksheet and start fresh. Just click the <b>new worksheet</b> button, as shown.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Load"><p class = "doc2">Loading a Program</p>
				<img src = "../images/load.gif" class = "left">
				To reload your program, or to load a different one into the worksheet, click the <b>load file</b> button, as shown. A dialog box will come up which will let you select which
				program you want to load.

		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Restore"><p class = "doc2">Restoring the Factory Program</p>
				<img src = "../images/restore.gif" class = "left">
				To restore the program the Scribbler came loaded with, plug the serial cable into the Scribbler's programming port and turn the Scribbler on. Then click the <b>restore</b>
				button. The Scribbler's factory program will then be uploaded. <i>This operation has no effect on the current worksheet.</i>
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Calibrate"><p class = "doc2">Calibrating the Scribbler</p>
				<img src = "../images/calibrate.gif" class = "left">
				The Scribbler comes from the factory with motor calibration constants and default light sensor constants programmed in. However, after an initial break-in period, if
				your Scribbler seems to have trouble moving in a straight line when you tell it to,
				it may be desirable to adjust the calibration. It's a simple process. Here's how to do it.<p>
				First, upload the calibration program using the <b>calibrate</b> button, shown here.<p>
				
				Place the Scribbler on a smooth surface where it has room to move forward.
				Then <b>press the reset button four times</b> in rapid succession. After a short delay, the Scribbler will <b>roll forward, then back</b>. While rolling forward, be sure to
				observe whether it moves straight, or curves to the right or left.<p>
				If it curves right, you will want to <b>adjust it to move left</b> a little more. To do this press the reset button <b>twice</b> in rapid succession. The left LED
				will flash, indicating the desired correction has been made. You can do this as many times as necessary.<p>
				If it curves left, you will want to <b>adjust it to move right</b> a little more. To do this press the reset button <b>three times</b> in rapid succession. The
				right LED will flash, indicating the desired correction has been made. You can do this as many times as necessary.<p>
				You can always <b>check your adjustments</b> by pressing the reset button <b>four times</b> in rapid succession and watching the Scribbler move forward and back.<p>
				To <b>calibrate the light sensors</b>, place the Scribbler on a flat surface in a well-lit room. Press the reset button <b>five times</b> in rapid succession, then
				stand back and <i>stand still</i>. The Scribbler will play a short tune and then begin to spin around on its center about five or six times.
				(If the room is too dark it will stop before the entire sequence is finished and emit a low-pitched buzz. Just brighten the room and try again.) It's important that there not be any motion in
				the Scribbler's field of view while it's spinning, so stand still! When the rotations stop, the Scribbler will play a final "Ta Da!", whereupon its 
				light sensors will have been calibrated.<p>
				To <b>erase the Scribbler's motor and light calibration</b> info and start over, press the reset button <b>six times</b> in rapid succession. You will hear two
				beeps, signifying that default calibration values have been set.<p>
				<i>None of these operations have any effect on the current worksheet. But you <i>do</i> have to upload the worksheet program to the Scribbler again in order to use it.</i>
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>		
			<div id = "Monitor"><p class = "doc2">Monitoring Sensors</p>
				<img src = "../images/monitor.gif" class = "left">
				The <b>monitor</b> button will give you access to the real-time sensor monitoring program.
				Make sure your Scribbler is powered up and connected to your PC, then click
				on the button, as shown, to transfer to the monitor program.<p>
				When the monitor program starts, you will be standing inside the Scribbler, just behind the doors to the Sensor Observation Deck, waiting for them to open.
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>
			<div>
				<img src = "../images/door_stuck.png" class = "left"><p>
				If the monitor program is unsuccessful in contacting the Scribbler, the doors <i>won't</i> open, and a red light will flash, as shown to the left.
				If this happens, double check to make sure the Scribbler is turned on, has fresh batteries, and is connected to your computer. Then try again.<p>
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>
			<div>
				<img src = "../images/doors_opening.png" class = "left"><p>
				However, if the monitor program is able to contact the Scribbler, the doors will slide open, and you will be able to see what's happening inside the Sensor
				Observation Deck.<p>
			</div>
		</td></tr><tr><td>
			<div>
				Once on deck, you will notice lights flashing and a large display screen. The flashing lights are the obstacle detector LEDs. Each side flashes in turn, and the little
				rectangular sensor in the center watches for a reflection from an obstacle on that side. If it sees one, a wall is shown in the lefthand panel of the display, as
				illustrated below.
				(Note: In the Scribbler, the LEDs actually emit infrared light, which is invisible to humans. But its sensor can see infrared, so is able to detect the
				reflections.)<p>
				The line sensor consists of two infrared LEDs and their associated detectors. The display shows the current state of the line sensor in the righthand panel.
				In the picture below, the righthand sensor is picking up a reflection; the lefthand one is not.<p>
				The light sensors reside behind the three oval holes near the top. As the light received by the Scribbler changes, these holes will brighten and darken in response.
				Also, the three bargraphs in the center panel of the display will rise and fall, and their associated numbers will change. You can use these numbers in your
				programs as settings for the light detector.<p>
				<img src = "../images/monitor_explain.png"><p>
				<b>IMPORTANT NOTES:</b><ul>
				<li>While the monitor program is running, you will not be able to upload any other programs to the Scribbler. If you try, you will get an error message.
				To upload another program, first
				exit the monitor program by clicking the "X" in its upper righthand corner.
				<li>After the monitor program exits, any program that was loaded before you started the monitor will have to be reloaded.
				<li>If the monitor program loses communication with the Scribbler, its display screeen will go blank. When communication is restored, the screen will again
				display sensor status.</ul>
				Oh, and one more thing: the Sensor Observation Deck is a busy place. Don't expect things to be the same every time you visit!

			<div id = "Help"><p class = "doc2">Help and Tooltips</p>
				<img src = "../images/help.gif" class = "left">
				To bring up this help file, you most likely clicked the <b>help</b> button, as shown. If the help button is lighted, the <b>tooltip</b> system is also enabled. Tooltips
				are little balloon boxes that pop up occasionally when you linger on a button or control for awhile. They're designed as reminders about what each control does. Once you
				become familiar with the program's functions, these tooltips may seem more annoying than helpful. In that case you can simply turn them off with a <b>right-click</b> on
				the <b>help</b> button. Another right-click will turn them back on, and so forth.<p>
