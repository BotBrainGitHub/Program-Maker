2/12/2012 Added changes to the conditional tile and motion tile, new help files per Bill
1/12/2012 Added changes to the include (TESTinclude.bs2) that will allow for a different scaling of the light sensor)
1/6/2012 12-2pm worked on debugging the new trim feature and testing.  It appears to be ready for Bill to test
1/5/2012 3-5pm worked on =(trim variable) and +(set max/min to 200/0)
start: 12/28/2011

Stable release version that needs few minor tweaks

- not done
= semi-done
+ done
todo:	+Trim variable (byte) (1/6)
	+set max/min to 200/0 (1/5)
	+Test the trim variable by "calibrating" with it (1/6)

done: 
	1-5-2012
	set max/min to 200/0 for left and right motors.  Changed lines 86, 90, 94, 95 in MotionTile.pm from += 128 to += 100
	Trim variable: Made the *currently red* slider on the window be the trim slider.  It will send the "Trim = $TrimValue" command
		upon compilation. The default trim is 128 and it's range is 0-255
	Created CalibrationMovement.bbm which will move the bot at full speed forward for 2 sec, then back for 2 sec

	Testing calibration with the Trim feature, it appears to be functional
	The trim range on the computer is from L127 to R127 with 0 as the center (0 - 254 on the pbasic code)
	changed the GUI per Joe's specs.  It looks much better

	1-12-2012
	Hoping to figure out a better way to rescale the light sensor readings. There is a test version in that Bill can play with

	2-12-2012
	The conditional tile had a unicode character <= in it, I remove it so it will now save
	I redid the motion tile so that it keeps track of individual trim values (needed for saving)
	Bill gave me new help files to make
