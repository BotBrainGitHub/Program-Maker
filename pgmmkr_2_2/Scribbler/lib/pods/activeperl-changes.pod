On Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) it is now possible to build Perl
extensions containing XS code.

=item *

On Windows the B<-t> operator now only returns a true value if the
filehandle is really connected to a console.  In earlier releases it
would return a true value for any kind of character device, including
the F<NUL> device.

=item *

The new B<ap-iis-config> utility can be used to configure IIS for use
with ActivePerl.  It works for all supported Windows versions and
their corresponding IIS releases, including Windows Vista, Windows
Server 2008, and Windows 7.

This tool is also used by the Windows installer to automatically
configure IIS during installation if requested by the installer
settings.

=item *

PPM is now capable of downloading modules from I<ActivePerl Business
Edition> repositories.  You can find more information about
I<ActivePerl Business Edition> at
http://www.activestate.com/business_edition

=item *

Most bundled modules have been updated to their latest released
version from CPAN.  Use the C<ppm query> command to check the exact
version included in this release.

The following security vulnerabilities in the Crypt::SSLeay module
were addressed in this release by upgrading the OpenSSL libraries to
version 0.9.8k:

=over

=item CVE-2009-0590 (ASN1 printing crash)

The function ASN1_STRING_print_ex() when used to print a BMPString or
UniversalString will crash with an invalid memory access if the
encoded length of the string is illegal.

Any OpenSSL application which prints out the contents of a certificate
could be affected by this bug, including SSL servers, clients and
S/MIME software.

=item CVE-2009-0789 (Invalid ASN1 clearing check)

When a malformed ASN1 structure is received it's contents are freed up
and zeroed and an error condition returned. On 64-bit Windows this can
cause an invalid memory access later resulting in a crash when some
invalid structures are read, for example RSA public keys.

Any OpenSSL application on 64-bit Windows which uses the public key of
an untrusted certificate could be crashed by a malformed
structure. Including SSL servers, clients, CA and S/MIME software.

=item CVE-2008-5077 (Incorrect checks for malformed signatures)

Several functions inside OpenSSL incorrectly checked the result after
calling the EVP_VerifyFinal function, allowing a malformed signature
to be treated as a good signature rather than as an error.  This issue
affected the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS.

One way to exploit this flaw would be for a remote attacker who is in
control of a malicious server or who can use a 'man in the middle'
attack to present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate
chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

=back

=item *

PerlEx no longer sets the MOD_PERL environment variable (the change from
build 825 has been reverted), as it has undesirable side-effects.

=item *

The C<-p> function used to always return a false value on Windows.  It
now correctly detects if the filehandle argument is a pipe or not.  Also
the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant is now defined.

=item *

A potential buffer overflow in Perl for ISAPI has been fixed.  Whenever
Perl for ISAPI wrote an error message to the log file it would
potentially write beyond the end of a heap buffer.

=item *

The following modules have been added to ActivePerl:

    Compress-Raw-Bzip2   2.019

=head2 Build 825 December 16, 2008

Build 825 is based on Perl 5.8.9 plus additional selected changes from
the Perl development branch.

I<Bug Fixes and Changes since build 824>

=over 3

=item *

Perl 5.8.9 has been incorporated.  See L<perl589delta.pod> for a
comprehensive list of core Perl changes since build 5.8.8.816.

=item *

PPM v4.4 is now included.  This release fixes an infinite recursion
problem in the 'ppm tree' command for packages that declared circular
dependencies, and it fixes the problem that caused installing packages
from F<.ppmx> files in other directories to fail.

This release also include tweaks to the heuristics for when to check
for updates to repository data.  PPM should no longer check the same
repo more than once each day.

The ppm command creates a log of the actions it takes. On Unix ppm used
to write the log file to the home directory of the user.  This
release move the F<ppm4.log> file into the F<~/Libraray/Logs>
directory on Mac OS X and into the F<~/.ActivePerl> directory for the
rest.  On Windows the log file goes into the temp directory as before.

=item *

PerlEx now sets the MOD_PERL environment variable (to "PerlEx/3.0")
so that modules that behave differently under mod_perl will behave
the same way under PerlEx (e.g. CGI::Carp).

=item *

The following modules have been added to ActivePerl:

    Package-Constants 0.1

=item *

The following bundled modules have been updated to their latest
versions:

    Archive-Tar       1.38-r1    1.40-r1

=head2 Build 824 September 4, 2008

Build 824 is based on Perl 5.8.8, but also includes all changes from
the Perl 5.8 maintenance branch up to change 34096 plus additional
selected changes from the Perl development branch.

I<Bug Fixes and Changes since build 822.2>

=over 3

=item *

Many updates and bug fixes in the Perl internals have been applied.
See the F<Changes> file in the source distribution for the complete
list.

=item *

Minimum system requirements have been changed: Windows 2000 and later
are supported Windows versions and Solaris 2.8 is the minimum Solaris
version.

=item *

PPM v4.3 is now included.  This version of PPM should be considerable
faster at parsing the F<package.xml> file and in updating the local
database.  This version also supports installing packages from
F<.ppmx> files.

=item *

PPM on Windows and Linux will use the "new" ActiveState PPM
repositories currently at http://ppm.activestate.com/beta which have a
bigger selection of modules available and will allow updating of
bundled core modules when updates become available.

The new repositories are configured on the server side; other
platforms will be switched to the new repositories once they become
available for them automatically.

=item *

ActivePerl::Config on Windows now dynamically sets the
$Config{ccversion} to the version of C<cl.exe>.  This allows
ExtUtils::MakeMaker to generate and embed manifest files into
extension DLL when required by the specific version of the C compiler.

=item *

The GCC support for Windows in ActivePerl::Config now adds the
C<-mms-bitfields> option to the C<ccflags> when compiling with GCC.
This forces identical struct layouts with Visual C++, which is used to
compile ActivePerl itself.  This has become important because core
Perl 5.10 now uses bit-fields for some important structures.

=item *

The tkkit libraries used by the C<Tkx> module have been updated with
the latest changes from ActiveTcl 8.5.4.

=item *

CVE-2006-4484 has been addressed in Tk.

=item *

On OS X the supplied F<sitecustomize.pl> script adds the
F<~/Library/ActivePerl/lib> directory to @INC, and PPM will install
into this directory by default because the
C</usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/site/lib> directory isn't writable
without C<sudo>.  Unfortunately F<~/Library/ActivePerl/lib> was also
used by ActivePerl 5.10, so you could end up with a mixture of 5.8 and
5.10 modules in that directory.  This release uses
F<~/Library/ActivePerl-5.8/lib> as a per-user Perl 5.8 specific
module area.

=item *

On Windows there is a special form of them system() function to start
processes asynchronously: C<< system(1, $cmd) >>.  It returns the
process id instead of the exit status so that the spawning application
can eventually use waitpid() to wait for the external process to
terminate.  Previous Perl releases only returned the lower 16 bits of
the process id; this version returns all 32 bits.

=item *

The following modules have been added to ActivePerl:

    Algorithm-Diff     1.1902
    Bit-Vector         6.4
    BSD-Resource       1.2901

    YAML-LibYAML       0.27

The DBD::Oracle module is only included in the 32-bit releases of
ActivePerl for Windows and Linux.  It does not include the Oracle
client libraries; instead it requires that either the regular client
libraries or the Oracle Instant Client is already installed and
configured on the system.

ActiveState recommends DBI and DBD::ODBC for accessing databases
using ODBC.  The Win32::ODBC module continues to be provided for
backwards compatibility, but new code should exclusively use
DBD::ODBC.

The PPM-Repositories module supplies a list of PPM repositories
provided by sources outside ActiveState.  It makes it easier to
discover and configure additional repositories in PPM.  For example
you can display a list of repositories available for the current
platform with:

    ppm repo suggest

Adding e.g. the University of Winnipeg repository maintained by Randy
Kobes is then as easy as:

    ppm repo add uwinnipeg

The PPM-Repositories list is used by the PPM GUI client as well.

The following security vulnerabilities are addressed in this release:

=over

=item *

CVE-2007-5116

Buffer overflow in the polymorphic opcode support in the Regular
Expression Engine (regcomp.c) in Perl 5.8 allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code by switching from byte to Unicode
(UTF8) characters in a regular expression.

=item *

Directory traversal vulnerability in Archive-Tar

Archive-Tar would extract files to locations outside the current
working directory if the tarball contained either absolute paths, or
relative paths containing "../" sequences.

This behavior is now disabled by default.  The
$Archive::Tar::INSECURE_EXTRACT_MODE variable can be set to a true
value to restore the old behavior.  The F<ptar> utility now requires
the B<-I> option to enable the insecure extraction mode.

Note that this vulnerability fix is not backwards compatible.  You can
set $Archive::Tar::INSECURE_EXTRACT_MODE in your F<sitecustomize.pl>
file to restore the insecure operation globally.

=back

=item *

ActivePerl 822 on HP-UX does not include PPM4 and therefore also
doesn't include the corresponding changes to the directory layout and
@INC directory order.  However, all additional modules were still
installed into the F<lib> instead of the F<site_lib> tree, breaking
PPM3.  In build 822.2 all non-core modules are installed in the
F<site_lib> tree again.

=item *

The following bundled modules have been updated to their latest
versions:

    ActivePerl-DocTools-2.2
    Archive-Tar-1.37.2
    DBI-1.601
    XML-Simple-2.18

=head2 Build 822.1 September 23, 2007

Build 822.1 is a rebuild of build 822 for HP-UX on PA-RISC.  The
original release had several modules compiled so that they would only
work on PA-RISC2.0 machines.  All modules in 822.1 are compatible with
the PA-RISC1.1 architecture again.

=head2 Build 822 Wednesday, Aug 1, 2007

Build 822 is based on Perl 5.8.8, but also includes all changes from the
Perl 5.8 maintenance branch up to change 31223 plus additional selected
changes from the Perl 5.9 development branch.

I<Bug Fixes and Changes since build 821>

=over 3

=item *

Additional updates and bug fixes in the Perl internals have been applied (on
top of the changes in build 821, which was only released on HP-UX).  See the
F<Changes> file in the source distribution for the complete list.

=item *

kill(0, $pid) was always returning TRUE in build 820 on Windows.  It now
returning the correct values again (bug 67519).

=item *

It is now possible to send "INT" signals to subprocesses on Windows, as long
as they are also running ActivePerl Build 822 or later.  For arbitrary
subprocesses, only "BREAK" and "TERM" signals will be delivered (bug 67871).

=item *

The MSI installer would under certain conditions insert invalid script
mappings into the IIS metabase, which could disable all script mappings
until the invalid entries have been manually removed.  This situation could
only happen if the user used the "Back" button in the installer to get back
to the component selection dialog, and then de-selected some previously
selected components (PerlEx and/or Perl for ISAPI).

The control flow in the installer has been fixed, and the code manipulating
the metabase has been safeguarded to prevent these invalid mappings (bug
68446).

=item *

The F<installer.bat> installer on Windows could create an incorrect script
mapping for the F<.pl> file extension (to "Perl " with the trailing
space). It now correctly maps to the "Perl" association (bug 68656).

=item *

$Config{installsitescript} now points to the same directory as
$Config{installsitebin} instead of defaulting back to $Config{installscript}
(bug 70844).

=item *

MinGW extension compilation support has been improved.  Build 820 added
support for $Config{lib_ext}, but broke in turn $Config{obj_ext} (bug
69025).  This has been corrected, and $Config{ldflags} is now adjusted
too. ActivePerl will also automatically search the F<MinGW/lib> directory
for additional libraries, and support linking against both F<.lib> and F<.a>
files.

Note that some MinGW support may get broken if ExtUtils::MakeMaker is being
updated directly to a newer version from CPAN (so don't do that if you are
using MinGW).

=item *

Build 822 is no longer compatible with the PDK 6 (Perl Dev Kit).  Please
stay with build 820 if you need to use PDK 6, or upgrade to PDK 7 if you
want to use ActivePerl 822.

=item *

The C<diagnostics> module from build 822 will not work correctly with
PerlApp from PDK 7 (on Windows only) because the F<perldiag.pod> file has
been moved from the F<lib/Pod> to the F<lib/pods> directory.  This will
be fixed in the PDK 7.1 release.

I<Special configuration of build 821 for HP-UX>

Build 821 on HP-UX does not include PPM4 or the Tkx module, and it
also does not have the simplified directory layout nor the changed
order of directories in @INC.  These changes will be introduced
for HP-UX in ActivePerl 5.10.

=over 3

=item *

Many updates and bug fixes in the Perl internals have been applied.
See the F<Changes> file in the source distribution for the complete
list.

=item *

Setting the ACTIVEPERL_CONFIG_CC environment variable to C<gcc> will
force the ActivePerl::Config module to use a GCC configuration even
when the vendor compiler is available on the PATH.  This option is
supported on HP-UX, Solaris, and Windows.

=item *

Windows NT support (broken in build 820) has been restored.

=item *

The command history of the debugger is now being saved and restored
between debugging sessions.

=item *

The various manpages including the FAQs have been updated in many
places. Especially the documentation regarding regular expressions,
and regarding Unicode has been expanded.  The I<Perl Unicode FAQ> has
been added as F<perlunifaq.pod> and the I<Perl Unicode Tutorial> as
F<perlunitut.pod>.

=item *

The I<Unicode Character Database> was updated from version 4.1.0 to
5.0.0.

=item *

stat() and -X file tests now work on dirhandles too.

=item *

sort() function can now be recursive.

=item *

The ${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE} variable now contains the native status
returned by the last pipe close, backtick (C<``>) command, successful
call to wait() or waitpid(), or from the system() operator.

=item *

If the ${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} variable is set to a true value, then
stat() on Windows will not try to open the file. This means that the
link count cannot be determined and file attributes may be out of date
if additional hardlinks to the file exist. On the other hand, not
opening the file is considerably faster, especially for files on
network drives.

=item *

The F<perl*.pod> files are now installed into the F<lib/pods> directory
on Windows.  Previously they were copied to the F<lib/Pod> directory
because the filesystem on Windows is not case sensitive.

=item *

The $Config{d_pseudofork} variable has been introduced to differentiate
between platforms with real fork() support and the fork() emulation
currently implemented on Windows.

=item *

The following module has been added to ActivePerl:

    Module-Pluggable-3.6

=head2 Build 820 Wednesday, Jan 24, 2007

Build 820 is based on Perl 5.8.8.

I<Bug Fixes and Changes since build 819>

=over 3

=item *

PPM has been upgraded to version 4.01.

=over 3

=item *

The PPM UI now supports install and uninstall of modules with
post-install or uninstall scripts.

=item *

PPM now always uses package.xml for the ActiveState repository and
doesn't fall back to downloading thousands of PPDs if the package.xml
file is temporarily unavailable.

=item *

PPM now runs post-install scripts in dependency order.

=item *

The --force option to 'ppm install' now allows files already installed
by other packages to be overwritten. Ownership of these files is
transferred to the new package.

=item *

Added --no-sync option to the 'ppm search', 'ppm install' and
'ppm upgrade' commands.

=item *

Added --max-ppd option to 'ppm repo sync' command.

=item *

Added 'ppm config' command.

=item *

Added 'ppm tree' command.

=item *

The 'ppm repo sync' command now always checks the server to see if
updates to the repository are available.

=item *

Improved compatiblity with PPD files from PPM3 repositories.

=item *

PPM4 now supports ZIP archives as the codebase of PPD files.

=item *

The 'ppm-shell' command on Windows now uses Term::ReadLine::Stub
for terminal I/O to provide command history recall.

=item *

On Windows, PPM state data is now stored in LOCAL_APPDATA instead of
APPDATA.  The database can be quite large and is therefore not suitable
for the roaming profile.

=item *

PPM now picks up modules from F<site>; but still looks in the F<perl>
area first.  This allows you to install Crypt-SSLeay in order to be
able to access C<https://...>-repositories.

=item *

Fixed a problem causing PPM to sometimes download package tarballs from
the wrong repository.

=item *

The PPM GUI now shows which repository a package comes from. The
Repository column is hidden by default.

=item *

The PPM GUI now warns about downgrades on modules selected for
installation which have a lower version number than the currently
installed version.

=item *

The PPM GUI used to drop all dependencies if some of them failed.  It
now keeps any remaining dependencies.

=item *

In the PPM GUI, package selection is not cleared if the install fails.
This makes it possible to retry without having to select all the same
packages again.

=item *

The PPM GUI now shows a download progress bar.

=item *

New PPM icon on Mac OS.

=back

=item *

There have been various improvements in Unicode handling on Windows.
Most of them rely on the fact that Windows stores a short 8.3 name for
each filename that is longer, or contains characters not in the system
codepage.  By using the short name Perl is able to access these files
throught the byte stream APIs that the Perl core is using.

If the generation of short filenames has been disabled, then filenames
containing characters outside the system codepage will still not be
accessible.  Since the short file names are stored by the file system,
this mechanism will also only work for existing files.  There is no
way to determine a short file name for files that have not yet been
created.

=over 3

=item *

readdir() and glob() will return the short name if the long name
cannot be represented in the system codepage.

=item *

The PATH environment variable is preprocessed and all entries using
characters that are not in the system codepage will be replaced with
their short name versions.  This preprocessing step will also remove
surrounding quote characters from all entries in the PATH variable.

The PATH cleanup happens early enough that F<perl.exe> will be able to
find scripts via the C<-S> commandline option in those "inaccessible"
directories.

=item *

Both $^X and the @INC entries derived from $^X (lib and site/lib
directories) will be converted to the short form, if necessary.

Note that installing ActivePerl into a directory whose name cannot be
represented in the system codepage is still discouraged.

=item *

Win32::GetCwd() will return a short name, if necessary, and
Win32::SetCwd() can accept a Unicode name.

=item *

The new Win32::GetANSIPathName() accepts a pathname that may contain
Unicode characters and returns the name in the system codepage.

The file or directory must already exist; otherwise characters not in
the system codepage will be translated using replacement characters
(usually '?'), resulting in a potentially invalid filename.

=item *

Win32::GetLongPathName() may return Unicode characters now.

=item *

Win32::GetFullPathName() will return a short name, if necessary.  Call
Win32::GetLongPathName() on the return value (in scalar context) to
get the full pathname in Unicode:

=item *

Win32::GetFolderPath() will return a short name, if necessary.  Call
Win32::GetLongPathName() on the return value to get the full pathname
in Unicode.

=item *

Win32::ExpandEnvironmentStrings() may return Unicode characters
because it will use the Unicode process environment directly.

Any changes to %ENV however will be propagated to the process
environment, and %ENV only stores byte strings.  There is currently
no API to set environment variables to a Unicode string.

=item *

Win32::MsgBox() now accepts Unicode strings for both the MESSAGE
and TITLE paramters.

=item *

Win32::LoginName() may return Unicode characters.

=back

=item *

The builtin Perl kill() function now support killing process trees by
using negative signal numbers on Windows too.  Currently kill() on
Windows will still only terminate processes owned by the same user,
even when the user is a member of the Administrators group.

=item *

Perl on Windows could hang indefinitely under certain conditions
involving more than one of: alarm(), sleep(), waitpid(), system() and a
GUI toolkit like Tk, wxPerl, Win32::GUI (or any other function that uses
a messageloop).  This indefinite loop should no longer occur.

=item *

The Windows installer now puts F<site\bin> in the PATH.

=item *

The Windows installer now detects and prevents installation on top of
ActivePerl 817 or earlier.  This is necessary because the changed
order of F<lib> and F<site/lib> in @INC would otherwise put old
modules from the previous installation in front of the new modules
bundled with this release.

Also see the installation guide for help on saving and restoring your
installed PPM modules with PPM-Profile.

=item *

The Windows installer for 64-bit ActivePerl will default the install
location to F<C:\Perl64> instead of F<C:\Perl>.  Installing both the
32 and 64 bit versions of ActivePerl into the same directory is not
supported.

The Start menu shortcut and the I<Add Remove Programs> entry for the
64 bit version are marked with a " (64-bit)" suffix to differentiate
them from the 32 bit versions.

=item *

Improved MingW compatiblity on Windows.

=item *

The lwp-request aliases GET, HEAD, POST are no longer installed; use
lwp-request directly instead.  These aliases created problems on
case-insensitive systems where they shadowed other commands.

=item *

Make HTTP::Daemon deal properly with 'HEAD' requests.  It used to
generate a content body for these causing confusion on persistent
connections.

=item *

The self-contained tkkits required by the Tcl module have been updated.

=item *

Restored the old (pre 818) behaviour of
C<ActivePerl::DocTools::WriteTOC()>.  It now only warns if it can't
write to the F<perltoc.html> file.

=item *

ActiveState::Browser now also looks for C<xdg-open>, C<galeon> and
C<opera> on Unix.  It also knows how to detect KDE/Gnome properly.

=item *

ActiveState::Scineplex now has a JSON output mode.

=item *

Long hostnames are now supported on HP-UX.

=item *

Many bundled modules have been updated to their latest versions:

    Archive-Zip-1.18
    Data-Dump-1.08
    DBD-SQLite-1.13
    HTML-Parser-3.56
    HTML-Tree-3.23
    Mac-Apps-Launch-1.93
    Mac-Errors-1.13
    Mac-Glue-1.30
    Win32-0.28
    XML-Simple-2.16

=item *

A patch has been applied to DBI-1.52 to make it more robust against
drivers not handling multiple result sets with different numbers of
columns correctly.  DBI wasn't upgraded to version 1.53 because that
one breaks compatibility with DBD-Sybase.

=item *

This is the first non-beta release of 64 bit ActivePerl.  It is
available for Windows and Linux on x64 as well as Solaris on Sparc.
The 64 bit Windows release does not include PerlScript, PerlEx, Perl
for ISAPI or PerlEz.

The 64 bit releases do not yet contain the Tcl and Tkx modules.

=item *

PPM has been rewritten; see Release Notes and L<ppm> for details.

=item *

All bundled modules and scripts are now installed in the C<perl> area
and the C<site> area is now completely empty in a new ActivePerl
installation.

=item *

Rearranged order of C<@INC>; modules installed in C<site> area now
take precedence over the bundled modules.

=item *

Simplified directory layout on Unix; no more architecture and version
specific directories.  This makes the layout the same as the Windows
version of ActivePerl.

=item *

Term::ReadLine console fix for Windows.

=item *

Avoid trying to read F<C:\dev\urandom> at startup on Windows.

=item *

The C<gridRemove> method has been enabled for Tk.pm.

=item *

The Win32::OLE module in libwin32 package has been upgraded from
version 0.1704 to version 0.1707.

in ClearVariantObject() check IDispatch/IUnknown variants
for NULL before calling Release() on them

=back

=item *

Double quotes are now displayed properly in the HTML documentation.

=item *

F<DynaLoader.o> has now been moved into F<libperl.so> on Unix.  This
makes it easier to embed perl and is the same arrangement as perl on
Windows.

=item *

Added ActiveState::Browser module to ActiveState-Utils.

=item *

Most files of the Perl installation are now readonly on Windows.

=item *

Added a workaround for Module::Install brokenness that affected
ActivePerl::Config (introduced in build 815).  This prevented some
modules to install under the CPAN shell.

=item *

Added error checks after execing PL_cshname or PL_sh_path.

=item *

Upgraded the core threads and threads::shared modules with
threads-1.12 and threads-shared-0.99 from CPAN.  This fixes the handle
leakage on Windows and allows setting the stack size for new threads.
It also fixes both the '!=' comparison operator for thread objects and
the crashes while joining threads that go re-introduced in build 816.

=item *

Fixed several bugs in the new implementation of alarm() for Windows.
They did manifest themselves by signals not being delivered, or by GUI
applications randomly hanging.

=item *

Restored binary compatibility for SvPV_nolen() and similar macros.
This incompatibility made it impossible to use perlapp for Unix on Tk
based applications.

=item *

Reintroduce PL_memory_wrap for binary compatibility.

=item *

The C<require> builtin now ignores directories matching the given name
when searching @INC.

ActivePerl build 816 is now also available as a 64 bit Beta release
for Windows and Linux on x86_64 as well as Solaris on Sparc.  The 64
bit Windows Beta does not include PerlScript, PerlEx, Perl for ISAPI
or PerlEz.

=item *

The ActivePerl Community License has been clarified.  It now
explicitly allows you to redistribute certain parts of ActivePerl as
part of applications generated by wrapping tools such as by PAR,
PerlApp and Perl2Exe.  Please refer to the license text for actual
terms and conditions.

=item *

ActivePerl for Mac OS X is now a Universal binary that supports all
Macintosh hardware natively.

=item *

ActivePerl for Solaris is now built with the vendor compiler.
Previous releases were built with the GNU compiler (gcc).

=item *

C<ActivePerl::Config> on Solaris and HP-UX now provide compatibility so
that extensions can be built using gcc.  This happens automatically if
the vendor compiler is not available on the target system.

=item *

ActivePerl now ships with a preinitialized C<CPAN::Config> module.
This avoids the need to go through the configuration dialog the first
the CPAN shell is invoked.  The configuration dialog can still be
invoked by the C<o conf init> command to the CPAN shell.

=item *

Syntax colored documentation and ActiveState::Scineplex is now
supported for all the Unix platforms.

=item *

Passive transfer mode is now the default for C<Net::FTP>.  This mode
is more likely to work with modern firewall setups.

=item *

Problem where 'perl -s' wasn't able to parse -foo=bar switches has
been corrected.

=item *

The stat() builtin would not return the expected result when passed a
directory name with trailing slashes on Windows.  This problem has
been fixed.

This problem caused the rmtree() function of the C<File::Path>
module introduced in build 815 to fail for such directory names on
Windows.

=item *

The C<IO::Socket::INET> is now more efficient and it does not rely on
getprotobyname("tcp") to be functional any more.

=item *

A problem where long groups entries could cause memory exhaustion has
been fixed.

=item *

A problem with the alarm() function on Windows 2003 has been fixed.

The PerlEx plugin for IIS has been added to ActivePerl for Windows.
It caches precompiled CGI scripts in memory to increase their
performance.

=item *

The table of contents for the HTML documentation has been reverted
back to the format used before build 813 (it no longer requires
JavaScript to be enabled).

=item *

ExtUtils::MakeMaker now generates and installs HTML documentation
automatically.  Regardless how modules are being installed (via PPM,
through the CPAN shell, or by manual compilation and installation),
the HTML documentation is always kept up-to-date.

=item *

Code snippets in the HTML documentation are syntax colored.  This
feature is currently only available on Windows and Mac OS X.

=item *

ActiveState::Scineplex has been added on Windows and Mac OS X.  This
module analyzes source code for various programming languages and is
being used to colorize the code snippets in the HTML documentation.

=item *

The ActivePerl::Config module has been added. It allows perl's
configuration options to be overridden.  The module can also
automatically reconfigure ActivePerl for alternative compilation
environments when the default compiler cannot be found.

On Windows, MakeMaker will use the F<gcc.exe> compiler from MinGW and
the F<dmake.exe> utility if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
F<cl.exe> and the F<nmake.exe> utility are not available on the
PATH. This will also work automatically from within the CPAN shell.

=item *

The F<perl-static> executable on Unix will now pick up a matching
Config.pm (there is no statically linked Perl on Windows).

=item *

File::Path's rmtree() function has been replaced to address
security vulnerability CAN-2005-0448.

=item *

Fixed incompatibility problem with Tk and Encode version 2.10 which was
introduced in build 813 (perl-5.8.7).

libwin32 has been updated to version 0.26:

=over 3

=item *

Win32API::File

New GetFileAttributes() function and corresponding constants.

Added GetFileSize(), getFileSize(), setFilePointer(), and
GetOverlappedResult() functions. The file position operations can use
Math::BigInt objects.

Experimental new object oriented interface added. This will be moved
into a separate module in a later release.

=item *

Win32API::Registry

Added DELETE/READ_CONTROL/WRITE_DAC/WRITE_OWNER/SYNCHRONIZE as KEY_*.

=item *

Win32::Clipboard

GetBitmap() should now work correctly with 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit,
16 bit, 24 bit, and 32 bit colors.

=item *

Win32::Console

Renamed GRAY to LIGHTGRAY and added definitions for the "real" GRAY
colors.

Added get_Win32_IPC_HANDLE() method so that Win32::IPC can wait
on a console handle.

Added SetIcon() method to change the icon of the window.

Don't export the scalar variables to %main:: but into the callers
namespace.

=item *

Win32::Process

Added get_Win32_IPC_HANDLE() method for Win32::IPC compatibility.

Added STILL_ACTIVE constant for GetExitCode().

Win32::Process::Open() now records the process ID correctly
for GetProcessID().  It also creates handle now that can be
used with the Wait() method.

=item *

Win32::Shortcut

The Save() function now calls Win32::GetLongPathName() on the filename
to make sure to use a fully qualified pathname.

The Save() will store the new filename as the 'File' property unless
the Shortcut object already has a 'File' property.

On Unix, provide a destructor for libperl.  This allows libperl to be
repeatedly loaded and unloaded by e.g. mod_perl without running out of
thread local storage slots.  On Windows this was already handled
correctly.

Perl 5.8.2 has been incorporated.  See L<perl582delta> for a list of
changes.

ActivePerl build 808 is still being compiled with the
C<-DNO_HASH_SEED> option to maintain binary compatibility with earlier
releases.  Perl 5.8.2 implements a new rehashing scheme that will kick
in dynamically based on the actual data being stored in a hash.  This
new scheme is backwards compatible and is enabled in ActivePerl build
808.

=head2 Build 807 Thursday, Nov 6, 2003

Build 807 is based on Perl 5.8.1.  This is the first release of ActivePerl
based on this new maintenance release of Perl.  This release is meant for
use in production systems.  However, owing to the sheer volume of changes
between Perl 5.8.0 and 5.8.1 that have been incorporated, please be sure
to test it thoroughly in a non-critical environment before you upgrade
your production systems.

Please check L<perl581delta> for a list of the major changes in Perl.
Only additional changes specific to ActivePerl are mentioned here.

I<Bug Fixes and Changes>

=over 3

=item *

Perl 5.8.1 has been incorporated.  See L<perl581delta> for a list of changes.

B<Important note:> The new I<Hash Randomization> feature has been
disabled in ActivePerl because it is not compatible with Perl 5.8.0.
If we enabled this feature then some modules compiled with 5.8.0 would
not work correctly with 5.8.1 and most modules compiled with 5.8.1
would not work at all with Perl 5.8.0.  This would require maintaining
separate PPM module repositories for 5.8.0 and 5.8.1.

To enable the I<Hash Randomization> feature you must recompile
ActivePerl from source and remove the C<-DNO_HASH_SEED> definition
from the C compiler options.  In that case you must compile all CPAN
modules yourself too because the PPM repository binaries will not be
compatible.

=item *

Windows 2003 Server is now officially supported.  The installer adds
entries to the IIS6 "Web Services Extensions" list for both "Perl CGI"
and "Perl ISAPI".  Both are set to "Prohibited" by default and must
be explicitly changed to "Allow" in the IIS Manager.

Win32::GetOSName() detects the release version of Windows 2003
correctly.

=item *

ActiveState::Rx module has been included.  This module is necessary to
use the Rx Toolkit in ActiveState Visual Perl.  You must upgrade
Visual Perl to version 1.8.1 to use the Rx Toolkit with Perl 5.8.

=item *

Many bundled modules have been updated to their latest versions:

    Archive-Tar-1.07
    Compress-Zlib-1.22
    Data-Dump-1.01
    Digest-MD2-2.03
    Digest-MD5-2.30

    XML-Parser-2.34
    XML-Simple-2.09

The I<upgrade> command has been fixed.

=item *

It is now possible to install from a file URL while not being
connected to the Internet.

=item *

PPM now works on Windows even when the Term::InKey module is
installed.

=back

I<Perl for ISAPI>

=over 3

=item *

Perl for ISAPI no longer uses line buffering for STDOUT.  This is
especially important for running under IIS6 which bypasses TCP/IP
nagling and directly sends every packet individually.

=item *

Perl for ISAPI used to close all open file handles before shutting
down the Perl interpreter.  The intention was to prevent file handle
leaks from buggy Perl scripts while running inside the IIS process.
Unfortunately Perl may still execute END blocks or call DESTROY
methods during final destruction and some file handles may get closed
twice in this scenario.

This creates a race condition: the file handle may already have been
re-opened by a different thread before the second close happens.  Perl
then closes a file handle it doesn't own anymore.  This may cause a
different page request to fail.

To avoid this race condition Perl for ISAPI will no longer try to
automatically close open file handles.  Therefore it is possible that
broken Perl applications will now start leaking file handles if they
don't close them correctly themselves.

I<PPM>

PPM has been upgraded to version 3.1.  It fixes most of the known
problems, including:

=over 3

=item *

PPM 3.1 now provides all the functionality of PPM 2.0 and 3.0.
PPM 2.0 is therefore no longer included in ActivePerl 5.8.

=item *

PPM now works correctly through a proxy server requiring basic
authentication.  Previous versions of PPM 3.0 only supported
proxy servers that did not require authentication.

=item *

PPM is now more robust in handling user-defined repository URLs.
For instance, URLs with a trailing slash no longer result in
fatal errors.

=item *

Support for ASPN Perl profiles has been much improved.  However,
at the time of this writing, the ActivePerl 5.8 repositories
do not yet support profiles.  This is expected to become available
shortly.

=item *

In previous versions of PPM 3, incorrect search results from the
repository (such as package names that do not have corresponding
PPD files) could crash the PPM3 client.  PPM now generates meaningful
error messages under these circumstances.

Several bug fixes and other improvements have been merged from the
Perl development track.  In particular, many of these fixes address
weaknesses in Unicode support.  See the ActivePerl source code diff
for the complete list of included changes.

=item *

Bugs in the Perl 5.8 integration of Perl for ISAPI and PerlScript
that resulted in failure to flush output correctly at the termination
of the script have been fixed.

=item *

On Windows, system() and backticks could return invalid status when
running under environments where the process has to handle Windows
messages.  PerlScript and Perl for ISAPI fall under this category.
The problem has been corrected.

=item *

On Windows, PerlScript and Perl for ISAPI were affected by a reentrancy
problem, which meant that recursive invocation of these two engines
could fail.  This problem has been corrected.

=item *

Tk and libwww-perl has been updated to their latest versions.

=item *

Win32::Shortcut no longer calls CoUninitialize() within an END block.
This avoids random coredumps from this module when its DESTROY methods
happen to get called after the END block executes.

=item *

PPM v2 and v3 can now optionally generate HTML documentation when
installing packages if POD documentation is found in the package.
This is controlled by the rebuildhtml option in PPM v2 and the
rebuild-html option in PPM v3.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation updates.

I<What's new in the 800 Series>

=over 3

=item *

This build corresponds to the Perl 5.8.0 source code release.

=item *

The 800 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
builds in the 500 or 600 series.  Any extensions built using binaries
from the ActivePerl 500 or 600 series will need to be recompiled.
Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been
built for 500 or 600 series builds.

=item *

Significant changes that have occurred in the 5.8.0 release
are documented in L<perl58delta>.

=item *

Support has been enabled for large file access on all platforms,
meaning that file manipulation facilities within perl can cope with
files larger than 2GB or 4GB.

=item *

Many new modules are included as a standard part of perl 5.8.0.  See
"Modules and Pragmata" in L<perl58delta> for a detailed list.
In addition, the Data::Dump module is now included with ActivePerl.
Many other modules have been updated to their latest versions.

=item *

PPM v3 is now included as the default C<ppm> executable.  PPM v2
continues to be available, and can be executed as C<ppm2>.
